Difference between @HostBinding and @HostListener?

HostListener - Declares a host listener.Angular will invoke the decorated method when the host element emits the specified event.
# HostListener - will listen to the event emitted by host element, declared with @HostListener.

HostBinding -Declares a host property binding.Angular automatically checks host property bindings during change detection. If a binding changes, it will update the host element of the directive.
# HostBinding - will bind property to host element, If a binding changes, HostBinding will update the host element. 


Component's template property:

Template

<!-- attention, we have the c_highlight class -->
<!-- c_highlight is the selector property value of the directive -->

<p class="c_highlight">
    Some text.
</p>

And our directive

import {Component,HostListener,Directive,HostBinding} from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
    // this directive will work only if the DOM el has the c_highlight class
    selector: '.c_highlight'
 })
export class HostDirective {

  // we could pass lots of thing to the HostBinding function. 
  // like class.valid or attr.required etc.

  @HostBinding('style.backgroundColor') c_colorrr = "red"; 

  @HostListener('mouseenter') c_onEnterrr() {
   this.c_colorrr= "blue" ;
  }

  @HostListener('mouseleave') c_onLeaveee() {
   this.c_colorrr = "yellow" ;
  } 
}
